<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>It is the intention of the authors to include sufficient
discussion and directions to teachers so that this book
may be taught with the highest possible degree of efficiency.
Under general directions to teachers will be found
a discussion of those points which concern all teachers
regardless of grade. In addition, preceding the word list
for each grade will be found supplementary directions
to aid the teachers in facing the problems peculiar to
that grade.</p>

<p>Special attention is called to the elaborate provision for
making the pupil intelligent and responsible in his attack
on his own spelling problems. This result is achieved by
the testing plan which discovers to the pupil his deficiencies;
by the standard scores which enable him to compare
his accomplishment with that of other children; by the
efficient method of study which is provided; and by the
unusually rigorous follow-up work given in the review
lessons. The authors therefore present this book to the
pupils and teachers of the United States as a contribution
to the solution of the problem of developing a nation of
good spellers.</p>

<h1>LIPPINCOTT'S<br />
HORN-ASHBAUGH SPELLER</h1>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h2>GENERAL DIRECTIONS TO TEACHERS.</h2>

<p><b>How the Teaching of Spelling May be Improved.</b>&mdash;The
teaching of spelling may be improved in three ways: first, by
selecting a better list of words for the pupil to study; second, by
placing before the pupils of each grade the words that are most
appropriate for them; and third, by introducing economical
procedures in learning. The first is the problem of the course of
study; the second, the problem of grading; and the third, the
problem of method.</p>

<p><b>The Vocabulary.</b>&mdash;To solve the first problem one must insure
that the pupils will study all words they are likely to use in
life outside the school. One must also insure that the pupils'
time will not be wasted through their being required to learn
words which they will never use. This problem has been solved
for you by the authors of the text. The vocabulary of the lessons
is taken from a compilation which Doctor Horn has made of ten
scientific investigations of the words used in writing letters.
These investigations, taken together, represent the careful
analysis of over three-quarters of a million running words of
correspondence. If you will analyze one letter, you will see
what a very great amount of work these investigations have required.
It seems very unlikely that any word commonly and
frequently used should have been overlooked in all of these
investigations.</p>

<p>These ten studies contain all of the information which is
available at the present time concerning what words are likely
to be used in writing letters. Accordingly, there is no word in
this speller which has not been reported in one or more of these
investigations. In addition, this vocabulary has been carefully
compared with all of the other types of reading and writing
vocabularies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
    Among these are the studies of children's themes, such as
those by Jones, by the teachers of New Orleans, Kansas City,
and Richmond, Virginia; the various studies of adult reading
vocabularies, such as those by Eldridge and Knowles, aggregating
over 140,000 running words; the studies of the vocabulary
of school readers, such as those by Packer, Housh, and Miller,
aggregating over one-half million running words. No word has
been taken from these studies which did not occur in the investigations
of the vocabulary of personal and business letters.
On the other hand, these studies showed quite clearly that the
words found as the result of the analysis of three-quarters of a
million running words of correspondence are really basic in any
writing vocabulary.</p>

<p>If you will examine the book, you will see that most of the
lessons are numbered with arabic numerals. These lessons contain
a minimum list of 3998 words found to be used most frequently.
You will notice, also, that beginning with grade three
there are in each grade supplementary lessons, marked S-1, S-2,
etc. These lessons include 580 additional words which are somewhat
less frequently used. The supplementary lessons are
distributed by grades, so that pupils who finish the minimum
work for any grade will have additional lessons to study for the
remainder of the year. However, before undertaking these
supplementary lessons, the teacher should make sure that her
pupils have learned thoroughly the minimum list which contains
the important words.</p>

<p><b>Plan of Review.</b>&mdash;The provision for the complete elimination
of spelling errors is particularly efficient and thoroughgoing.
Not only are those words which most commonly give difficulty
arranged for, but the method of testing insures that each pupil
will eliminate his own peculiar errors. No pains have been
spared to obtain this thoroughness without wasting the pupils'
time in mere routine review.</p>

<p>During the week in which each lesson is taught for the first
time, each pupil is tested three times on every word in the lesson.
He spends his time in concentrated attack on the words which
have given him difficulty. One month later this lesson is given
as a test, and the words missed by each pupil re-learned by him.
At the end of the week this lesson is again given as a test.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
    In addition, at the beginning of each grade above the first,
the words which have been previously taught, but which according
to Doctor Ashbaugh's investigation still give difficulty,
are thoroughly reviewed. Finally, in the seventh grade, the
words which are most frequently missed by grammar grade
pupils are given additional review.</p>

<p>It must be kept in mind that these reviews are not haphazard,
nor are they a matter of guesswork. Each review list
is made up on the basis of the most careful scientific study
of persistent errors.</p>

<p><b>Grading.</b>&mdash;The lessons in each grade are those which the
pupils in that grade may most profitably study. The words
have been graded in the following manner: On the basis of
Doctor Horn's compilation of correspondence vocabularies, all
of the 4578 words were ranked according to the frequency with
which they are used in correspondence. On the basis of Doctor
Ashbaugh's study of the difficulty of these words in the various
grades, the words were arranged in order of ease of spelling.
With these two sources of data, the lessons are arranged so that
in general the easiest words and those most commonly and
frequently used are placed in the lower grades. In addition,
on the basis of scientific analysis of the vocabulary of first,
second, and third readers, the authors determined which words
occurred most often in these readers. The words included in the
lessons for the first three grades are not only easy and fairly
common, but are found also in popular readers of the grades in
which they are placed. For example, the word "and" was found
23,773 times in the letters analyzed in the various investigations
upon which the book is based; and it is misspelled by
but four second grade children out of a hundred. It also occurs
in every one of ten commonly used first readers. Since it is one
of the very commonest words, is easy to spell, and is found in
all first readers, it is placed in the first list in the book. In a
similar way every lesson in the first three grades has been a
matter of computation. The lessons in grades above the
third have been made in the same careful fashion, except that
occurrences in readers were not taken into consideration. It is
clear that the lessons increase gradually in difficulty in each
successive grade, and that a pupil who is forced to leave school
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
at the end of grade six or seven will have learned the words which
he is most likely to need in writing.</p>

<p><b>Standard Scores.</b>&mdash;By means of standard errors at the close
of each lesson, the pupils and teachers may compare results with
those of other grades and with those obtained in the country at
large. These standards were taken from the Ashbaugh Scale
and from a supplementary study conducted by Doctor Ashbaugh
and Doctor Horn to determine the standards for words not included
in the original scale. It must be kept in mind that these
standard errors are high, being the result of the present unfavorable
conditions of the teaching of spelling in the country
at large. They are used merely for the purpose of comparison.
The ideal to keep before your class is that they should learn
their lessons so that they will not misspell a single word, but
this ideal is intensified by the use of the standard errors.</p>

<p><b>How to Teach the Lesson.</b>&mdash;Four points must be kept in
mind as more important than any others:</p>

<p>1. The teacher must test her pupils on each lesson before
they begin to study.</p>

<p>2. Each pupil should study only the words which he misspelled
on the test.</p>

<p>3. He must be taught an economical method of study.</p>

<p>4. He must see clearly what progress he is making.</p>

<p>Detailed suggestions for teaching the lessons are given in the
paragraphs which follow. These suggestions are based upon the
investigations reviewed by Doctor Horn in the Eighteenth
Yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Education.
The method has been tried out thoroughly in public school
classrooms, and has proved uniformly successful. Teachers are
urged to follow it as closely as possible. If, however, the teacher
prefers another method of study, she may use it. The book may
be used with any method.</p>

<p><b>Getting Started Right.</b>&mdash;The first few lessons may well be
spent in systematizing class procedure and teaching pupils how
to study a spelling lesson. Begin by pointing out the importance
of spelling. Give cases, if possible, where people have been
discredited because of spelling errors in letters. Discuss with
the class how the words in this book were selected, how the standard
errors at the close of each lesson were secured, and how the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
method of study was determined. The pupils may now be
introduced to the procedure which will be used in conducting
the spelling class, and to the method of study.</p>

<p><b>Teaching Pupils How to Work.</b>&mdash;Many teachers have found
the following procedure very satisfactory. Have the pupils
open their books at the first lesson for their grade. Explain to
them that a great many men have spent much time and money
in finding out the best way to learn to spell, and that the method
which is to be used is based on what these men have recommended.
Have the class read the directions to pupils given on
pages <a href="#Page_xiv">xiv</a>&ndash;<a href="#Page_xvi">xvi</a>.
    After the directions have been read, have several
pupils summarize them. When you have made sure that the
class has the main points clearly in mind, the actual work of
habituating the method may be begun. The first few lessons in
each term should consist of practice in the method of study.
This practice should be continued until you are satisfied that the
pupils understand thoroughly how to go about their work. Remember
that even though teachers in the preceding grades are
using the method, there may be pupils in your grade who are
new to the system, as well as some who have forgotten how to
study. From the nature of the method, it is easy to detect any
child who is not using it. Insist that the correct method be used
from the outset. As soon as the pupils have learned the method
of study, the regular work of learning the lessons may begin.</p>

<p><b>How the Lessons Should be Taught.</b>&mdash;The lessons are planned
to be completed in a week. A week's work, therefore, consists
of twenty new words and twenty review words except in grade
one, where the week's work consists of ten new words and ten review
words. The following schedule is recommended.</p>

<p><b>Monday.</b>&mdash;The first step in teaching a lesson is an exercise
in pronunciation. Have the pupils open their books at the
advanced lesson. Pronounce each word, enunciating the syllables
very distinctly. Each word which in your judgment is not
understood by the class should be used in a sentence. All
homonyms should be so used. Have the pupils pronounce each
word after you in concert, enunciating the syllables very distinctly.
Insist on careful pronunciation on the part of every pupil.</p>

<p>This exercise precedes the spelling test because of the importance
of pronunciation in the method of study, and because of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
the probability that this initial attention to the correct form of
the word is desirable. Since the pupils undoubtedly learn something
as a result of this exercise, they may be expected to make
somewhat better scores than those given in the book. These
scores are the results of tests given without such a preliminary
exercise in pronunciation.</p>

<p>After all the words have been pronounced, have the pupils
close their texts and prepare papers for a written test. This test
will include the new lesson. It may be written on any sort of
paper, the words being written in columns of twenty to correspond
to the arrangement of the words in the book. Pronounce
each word once only. Pupils should write the words without
hesitation. No alterations in the first attempt at spelling the
word should be allowed.</p>

<p>After the words have all been dictated, have the pupils exchange
papers for the purpose of correcting. Be sure that each
pupil understands that he is marking his neighbor's paper, so
that errors which have been made may be corrected. Instruct
the class to mark a word wrong if it is misspelled, if it cannot be
read, or if any change in the first attempt at spelling has been
made. Be sure that each pupil understands that, until he is able
to write a word correctly the first time, he has not sufficiently
learned it.</p>

<p>The words may be corrected on the basis of the teacher's oral
spelling or by the book. Each word found to be misspelled
should be marked wrong by placing after it an <b>X</b>.</p>

<p>When the papers have been returned to the owners, each
pupil should write the correct form of the words which he has
misspelled. The words missed on the test will constitute his
task for the week.</p>

<p><b>Tuesday.</b>&mdash;On Tuesday the pupils study, each working on
his own errors and using the method recommended under directions
to pupils. Pupils who made no errors on the test may
be excused from this study period, but not from the succeeding
test. It frequently happens that a pupil will spell a word correctly
on one test and misspell it on a following test.</p>

<p>The teacher should closely supervise the pupils' study in
order to insure that proper methods of learning are used. She
may also help to direct the work of those who, having made no
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
errors on the preceding test, have been allowed to undertake
some other task. The class should not be tested on this day.</p>

<p><b>Wednesday.</b>&mdash;Test on the new and on the review lesson.
This review lesson should consist of a lesson taught one month
before. Since the first four lessons in each grade are made up of
words taught in the preceding grade, these may well be used for
the first month as review lessons. The words may be corrected
and the errors recorded as on Monday. Compare the number of
errors made on this test with those made on the preceding test.
This comparison will show the pupil what progress he has made.
The remainder of the period may be spent in studying the words
missed on this test.</p>

<p><b>Thursday.</b>&mdash;Study as on Tuesday.</p>

<p><b>Friday.</b>&mdash;Test on the new and on the review lesson, correct
the papers as on Monday, and spend the rest of the period studying
the errors made on this final test. Compare the number of
errors made on this test with the number made on the first and
second tests. The comparison gives the child a measure of
accomplishment for the week. The teacher should check this
day's papers in order to have an accurate record of the status of
the pupils at the close of the week's work. Many teachers have
found it helpful to keep a chart of progress on the blackboard.</p>

<p><b>Individual Instruction.</b>&mdash;It is clear from the preceding directions
that the method of learning and the class administration
are intended to insure that each pupil will learn those words
which give him difficulty, and that he will, at the same time,
progress at his own rate. With the possible exception of the
fact that only the commonly used words are taught, this is the
most important provision in the book.</p>

<p><b>The Spelling Notebook.</b>&mdash;It has been found to be very helpful
to have each pupil keep a notebook in which to record words
missed in the various spelling tests or in papers written in connection
with other subjects. This notebook tends to make the
pupil more conscientious with regard to his spelling. It also
gives him a record of his errors so that when he has time for
review work he can utilize it properly.</p>

<p><b>The Problem of Interest.</b>&mdash;Teachers who have used the
method which is here recommended have been unanimous in
reporting not only that the pupils learned more rapidly, but also
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
that they worked with greater enthusiasm. This increased interest
is secured without any use of soft pedagogy. It comes
from several sources. First, the pupils know that the words in
the book are those most commonly needed in writing. Second,
the pupils quickly see the advantage of centering their efforts
on words which they have actually missed. Third, by means of
standard scores they are enabled to compare their spelling
ability with that of children in other parts of the country.
Fourth, they can see what they are accomplishing. Fifth, these
provisions make possible the joy which comes from doing vigorously
and thoroughly a clean-cut task that needs to be done.
These are the interests which appeal to sensible men and women
in life outside the school, and they have proved sufficient for
children. Many attempts have been made to substitute devices
for these wholesome and fundamental interests. Such attempts
not only fail in their purpose, but actually distract the child's
mind from the work he has to do. Sugar-coating inevitably
destroys the child's appetite for healthy vigorous work.</p>

<h2>DIRECTIONS TO PUPILS</h2>

<p><b>Why These Words Should be Studied.</b>&mdash;One of the ways by
which people judge the writer of a letter is by the presence or
absence of spelling errors. Often a young man or young woman
has failed to obtain a desirable position because of spelling errors
in a letter of application. Even in the ordinary friendly letter,
spelling errors make a bad impression. The words which you
are to learn from this spelling book are the words which people
most frequently use in writing letters. Thousands of letters
were read, and each word found was recorded. This book, therefore,
contains the words most commonly used in writing, and
does not contain any word which has not been found in letters.</p>

<p><b>How to Learn the Words.</b>&mdash;The first step in the study of each
lesson will be an exercise in pronunciation. Your teacher will
pronounce each word for you. Look at your book closely, noticing
each syllable as she pronounces it. When the teacher asks
you to pronounce the word after her, look at each syllable closely
as <i>you</i> pronounce it.</p>

<p>The second step in learning the lesson is the test. Write each
word as plainly as you can and without hesitation. The purpose
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
of this test is to see whether or not there are any words in
the lesson which you cannot spell. The words which you cannot
spell will be your work in spelling for the week.</p>

<p>If your teacher asks you to exchange papers for the purpose
of correcting them, be sure to do your work very carefully. If
you fail to mark a word wrong that has been misspelled, the
pupil whose paper you marked will not be able to know that
the word should be studied, and so will suffer an injury. On the
other hand, it will be very confusing if you mark a word wrong
which is really correct. Mark any word wrong that you cannot
easily read; also any word if a letter has been written over or a
change made. Remember that the purpose of the test is to find
out which words need to be studied. The grades of the pupil whose
papers you correct are not affected in any way by your marking.</p>

<p><b>The Meaning of "The Standard Number of Errors."</b>&mdash;The
words in this book have been given to a great many children
in each grade in a number of cities. In that way it was possible
to find out the number of errors which children of each grade
ordinarily make. If you will compare the number of errors which
you make on the test with the number of errors at the bottom of
your lesson, you will be able to see how your spelling compares
with that of pupils in other parts of the country.</p>

<p><b>How to Learn to Spell a Word.</b>&mdash;A great many men have
spent much time and money in finding out for you the best way
to learn to spell. The directions which follow are based on
what these men have discovered.</p>

<p>1. The first thing to do in learning to spell a word is to pronounce
it correctly. Pronounce the word, saying each syllable
very distinctly, and looking closely at each syllable as you say it.</p>

<p>2. With closed eyes try to see the word in your book, syllable
by syllable, as you pronounce it in a whisper. In pronouncing
the words, be sure to say each syllable distinctly. After saying
the word, keep trying to recall how the word looked in your book,
and at the same time say the letters. Spell by syllables.</p>

<p>3. Open your eyes, and look at the word to see whether or
not you had it right.</p>

<p>4. Look at the word again, saying the syllables very distinctly.
If you did not have the word right on your first trial,
say the letters this time as you look sharply at the syllables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
    5. Try again with closed eyes to see the word as you spell
the syllables in a whisper.</p>

<p>6. Look again at your book to see if you had the word right.
Keep trying until you can spell each syllable correctly with
closed eyes.</p>

<p>7. When you feel sure that you have learned the word, write
it without looking at your book, and then compare your attempt
with the book to see whether or not you wrote it correctly.</p>

<p>8. Now write the word three times, covering each trial
with your hand before you write the word the next time, so that
you cannot copy. If all of these trials are right, you may say
that you have learned the word for the present. If you make a
single mistake, begin with the first direction and go through each
step again.</p>

<p>9. Study each word by this method. Take special pains
to attend closely to each step in the method. Hard and careful
work is what counts.</p>

<p><b>Take Pains with Your Spelling in all Writing.</b>&mdash;Take pride
in having your compositions and letters free from spelling
errors. When you are in the slightest doubt as to how to spell a
word, look it up in the dictionary before you write it. When you
have found the word in the dictionary, learn it by the method by
which you study your regular spelling lessons. In a similar
way, if you do make a mistake in spelling in your compositions,
learn the word which you misspelled by this same method.</p>

<p><b>Reviews.</b>&mdash;Whenever you have a few minutes after having
prepared some lesson, turn back to the errors which you have
made on previous spelling tests and spend some time going over
the words which you missed on those tests. Occasionally when
you are at home, you will find it interesting to have your mother
or father or some friend test you over all the words you have
missed during the year. You should not be satisfied until you
can spell every word correctly.</p>

<p><b>Notebook.</b>&mdash;Keep a spelling notebook. Whether your
teacher requires it or not, you will find it very much worth
while to keep a spelling notebook. In this you should record
all words missed on any test or in compositions which you
write. If you find that you are frequently missing a word,
write it in a special list and review it frequently.</p>

<h1>FIRST GRADE</h1>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>
<h2>DIRECTIONS TO FIRST GRADE TEACHERS</h2>

<p>The words in the lessons for first grade children are
few in number and relatively easy. You will notice that
most of them are phonetic. Each word has been found
to be used in correspondence and in a majority of first
grade readers. This list is therefore particularly appropriate
for first grade children and may be easily learned
by them. The authors recommend that this work be
begun in the second half year.</p>

<p><b>Directions for Teaching.</b>&mdash;Read again the general
directions on pages <a href="#Page_vii">vii</a> to <a href="#Page_xvi">xvi</a>, inclusive. In general the
method used in grade one is the same as that used in
later grades. There are, however, certain important
differences. You will notice, for example, that first grade
lessons contain ten instead of twenty words. You will need
also to give more attention for the first two or three weeks
to initiating correct habits of study. Remember that
teachers above grade one will build upon habits which
you initiate.</p>

<p>The words in the first grade list are very simple, so
that there should be no difficulty in learning to spell
them. Neither should the children have any difficulty in
understanding any of the one hundred fifty words.</p>

<p><b>Directions for Schools in Which the Pupils do Not
Write in Grade One.</b>&mdash;The pupils in such schools should
be taught to study according to the first six directions
given under How to Learn to Spell a Word, page <a href="#Page_xv">xv</a>.
The tests in these cases will have to be oral tests. Otherwise,
the methods recommended in the general directions
may be used.</p>

<h1>SECOND GRADE</h1>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<h2>DIRECTIONS TO SECOND GRADE TEACHERS</h2>

<p>The second grade list of words contains 340 new words
in addition to the review lessons, which include 80 of the
most difficult first grade words, and 60 of the homonyms
which give the most trouble. The new words are all
words frequently used, are words which second grade
children can learn easily and, for the most part, are frequently
found in the second readers most commonly used.
You will find that the method outlined below will enable
you to teach these words so that your classes will make
very nearly a perfect score on them.</p>

<p><b>Directions for Teaching.</b>&mdash;Read again the directions
for teaching as given on pages <a href="#Page_vii">vii</a> to <a href="#Page_xvi">xvi</a>. You will find it
advisable to take some time at the beginning of the term
to teach pupils how to study. You will still find it necessary
to correct the papers yourself. You may follow the
same schedule as that outlined in the general directions.
Watch particularly for improper methods of study.</p>

<p>Second grade pupils should write their tests without
hesitation and with fair speed. Explain to the pupils
with great care that letters which are not made plainly
will be counted wrong.</p>

<p>Remember that the lessons are arranged by weeks
rather than by days. The work for each week consists of
one advance column and one review column. The review
column in each case is the fourth column preceding the
advance work. That is, it is made up of a week's work
one month old. For example, column 5 contains 20 new
words to be learned in one week. During the same week,
column 1 should be reviewed. The lesson for the first
week consists of column 1, which is the advance lesson,
and of column R 1, which is the review.</p>

<h1>THIRD GRADE</h1>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<h2>DIRECTIONS TO THIRD GRADE TEACHERS</h2>

<p>The advance lessons, numbered 1 to 28 inclusive, contain
a minimum list of 528 new words. The supplementary
list contains 80 words, which although easy to
spell are not so frequently used in writing letters as are
the words of the minimum list. This supplementary list
is meant for those schools which because of the long school
term or for other reasons, finish the minimum list before
the end of the term or year. The lessons marked R-1,
R-2, R-3, R-4, are made up of the eighty words taught
in preceding grades, but which still give considerable
difficulty to third grade children. They should be thoroughly
mastered.</p>

<p><b>Directions for Teacher.</b>&mdash;For the first few lessons
direct your attention to systematizing class procedure
and to teaching pupils how to study effectively. Read
carefully again the suggestions on pages <a href="#Page_vii">vii</a> to <a href="#Page_xvi">xvi</a>.</p>

<p>Pupils in the third grade should be able to make their
own corrections so that time may now be saved by having
the pupils exchange papers during the first two tests. The
teacher should continue to correct the papers written on
the final test. The following suggestions will be helpful
in getting the coöperation of pupils. After the papers
have been exchanged say, "In writing, it is important
not only that you know how to spell, but also that you
make your letters so that the person who reads your paper
can tell easily what you have written. This is the reason
that I have asked you to exchange papers. Many people
write so that certain letters cannot be told from other
letters. This is true of z, g, and y; o and a; t and l; n
and u; h and k. When you correct papers and cannot
tell which of two letters the writer intended, mark the
word wrong. Also mark it wrong if a letter has been
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
written over or a change made. Words should be learned
so that they will be written correctly without hesitation
the first time. Any word which has not been learned so
that it may be written correctly the first time should be
studied again.</p>

<p><a name="quote" id="quote">"</a>Remember that the purpose of this test is to find out
which words need further study. It does not affect your
grades. You will do the pupil whose paper you have a
favor by marking his errors so that he may correct them.
Mark each error by placing after it a cross&mdash;so (x)."</p>

<p>Pupils should keep a special list of words which they
have missed in their compositions. These words should
be studied by the same method used in studying the regular
spelling lesson. Such words will not be taken up,
however, in the regular lessons.</p>

<p>Remember that the lessons are arranged by weeks
rather than by days. The work for each week consists
of one advance column and one review column. The
review column in each case is the fourth column preceding
the advance work. That is, it is made up of a week's
work one month old. For example, column 5 contains
20 new words to be learned in one week. During the same
week, column 1 should be reviewed. The lesson for the
first week consists of column 1, which is the advance
lesson, and of column R 1, which is the review.</p>

<h2>DIRECTIONS TO FOURTH GRADE TEACHERS</h2>

<p>The advanced lessons numbered 1 to 32 inclusive
contain 620 new words. The supplementary list containing
80 new words is meant for schools which because of
the long term or for other reasons, finish the minimum list
of words before the end of the year. The lessons marked
R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, are made up of the 80 words in the
third grade list which are most commonly misspelled by
fourth grade children. These 80 words should be thoroughly
mastered. There are also reviewed 20 homonyms
which commonly are confused by children of this grade.</p>

<p><b>Directions for Teaching.</b>&mdash;Read the preface and study
with particular care the suggestions given on pages <a href="#Page_vii">vii</a>
to <a href="#Page_xvi">xvi</a>. It would be well also to read the suggestions to
first, second and third grade teachers. You will need to
supervise the correction of papers by pupils very closely.</p>

<p>Remember that the lessons are arranged by weeks
rather than by days. The work for each week consists of
one advance column and one review column. The review
column in each case is the fourth column preceding the
advance work. That is, it is made up of a week's work
one month old. For example, column 5 contains 20 new
words to be learned in one week. During the same week,
column 1 should be reviewed. The lesson for the first
week consists of column 1, which is the advance lesson,
and of column R 1, which is the review.</p>

<h1>FIFTH GRADE</h1>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>
<h2>DIRECTIONS TO FIFTH GRADE TEACHERS</h2>

<p>The minimum lessons for this grade are numbered
from 1 to 32, and contain 620 new words of the minimum
list. The lessons marked R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, are made
up of words from the fourth grade lessons which are most
frequently misspelled by fifth grade children. In addition
to these eighty review words, there is one review lesson
containing homonyms. There are also two supplementary
lessons made up of words which are new but which are
not so commonly used as those in the minimum list. As
in preceding grades, these supplementary lessons are
introduced in order to afford additional work for classes
which finish the regular lessons before the end of the year.
There are also two lessons containing names of the months,
days of the week, and certain abbreviations.</p>

<p><b>Directions for Teaching.</b>&mdash;Read carefully the suggestions
on pages <a href="#Page_vii">vii</a> to <a href="#Page_xvi">xvi</a>. Read also the suggestions to
teachers of the first four grades. See to it that your pupils
attack their lessons in an aggressive manner. The pupils
in grade five do considerable work in written composition,
so it will be well to watch very closely the errors made in
such work. Have the pupils learn all words misspelled in
their written work, using the same method as in their
regular spelling lessons.</p>

<p>Remember that the lessons are arranged by weeks
rather than by days. The work for each week consists of
one advance column and one review column. The review
column in each case is the fourth column preceding the
advance work. That is, it is made up of a week's work
one month old. For example, column 5 contains 20 new
words to be learned in one week. During the same week,
column 1 should be reviewed. The lesson for the first
week consists of column 1, which is the advance lesson,
and of column R 1, which is the review.</p>

<h1>SIXTH GRADE</h1>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>
<h2>DIRECTIONS TO SIXTH GRADE TEACHERS</h2>

<p>The advance lessons numbered 1 to 32 inclusive contain
640 new words. The supplementary list containing
80 new words is meant for schools which, because of the
long term or for other reasons, finish the minimum list
of words before the end of the year. The lessons marked
R-l, R-2, R-3, R-4, are made up of 80 words in the fifth
grade list which are most commonly misspelled by sixth
grade children.</p>

<p><b>Directions for Teaching.</b>&mdash;Read the preface and study
with particular care the suggestions given on pages <a href="#Page_vii">vii</a> to
<a href="#Page_xvi">xvi</a>. It would be well also to read the suggestions given to
teachers of the first five grades. Give particular attention
to the correction of all written work.</p>

<p>Remember that the lessons are arranged by weeks
rather than by days. The work for each week consists of
one advance column and one review column. The review
column in each case is the fourth column preceding the
advance work. That is, it is made up of a week's work
one month old. For example, column 5 contains 20 new
words to be learned in one week. During the same week,
column 1 should be reviewed. The lesson for the first
week consists of column 1, which is the advance lesson,
and of column R 1, which is the review.</p>

<h1>SEVENTH GRADE</h1>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>
<h2>DIRECTIONS TO SEVENTH GRADE TEACHERS</h2>

<p>The minimum lessons for this grade are numbered
from 1 to 30 inclusive and contain 600 new words. The
supplementary lessons contain 60 new words which are
not so commonly used as those in the minimum lessons.
As in preceding grades, these supplementary lessons are
introduced in order to afford additional work for classes
which finish the regular lessons before the end of the year.
The lessons marked R-l, R-2, R-3, R-4, are made up of
words from the sixth grade lessons which are most frequently
misspelled by seventh grade children.</p>

<p><b>Directions for Teaching.</b>&mdash;Read carefully the suggestions
on pages <a href="#Page_vii">vii</a> to <a href="#Page_xvi">xvi</a>. Read also the suggestions to
teachers in the first six grades. As in grades four, five
and six, the spelling errors found in pupils' compositions
should be rigorously corrected.</p>

<p>Remember that the lessons are arranged by weeks
rather than by days. The work for each week consists of
one advance column and one review column. The review
column in each case is the fourth column preceding the
advance work. That is, it is made up of a week's work
one month old. For example, column 5 contains 20 new
words to be learned in one week. During the same week,
column 1 should be reviewed. The lesson for the first
week consists of column 1, which is the advance lesson,
and of column R 1, which is the review.</p>

<h1>EIGHTH GRADE</h1>


<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
<h2>DIRECTIONS TO EIGHTH GRADE TEACHERS</h2>

<p>The minimum lessons for this grade are numbered
from 1 to 25 inclusive, and contain 500 new words. There
are in addition 240 supplementary words which are new,
but which are not so frequently used as those in the minimum
list. The four lessons marked R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4,
are made up of those words in the preceding grades which
are most frequently missed by eighth grade students.
The lesson marked "Special Review," contains the hardest
words, of the two thousand most frequently used
in correspondence.</p>

<p>In addition, there are four letters which should be
given as dictation exercises. These letters contain a
large number of words which are very likely to be misspelled,
as shown by their frequency of use in correspondence
and the percentage of error of eighth grade pupils
who attempt to spell them.</p>

<p>Remember that the lessons are arranged by weeks
rather than by days. The work for each week consists of
one advance column and one review column. The review
column in each case is the fourth column preceding the
advance work. That is, it is made up of a week's work
one month old. For example, column 5 contains 20 new
words to be learned in one week. During the same week,
column 1 should be reviewed. The lesson for the first
week consists of column 1, which is the advance lesson,
and of column R 1, which is the review.</p>

<h2>USE OF THE CONTRACTION</h2>

<p>One of the first things to learn in writing letters is that
the form and style of the letter must be suited to the
message which the letter contains, and to the relationship
which exists between the person who sends the letter and
the one who is to receive it. The style of business letters
must be clear, direct, and dignified. With certain exceptions,
as in sales letters, such letters are usually made
very impersonal. On the other hand, personal letters are
quite properly regarded by many as a sort of conversation
in writing. In writing to friends or to relatives one
usually desires to be informal. One of the ways of achieving
this informality is through the use of colloquial English
and contractions. In the past, many teachers of
English have cautioned students against the use of contractions
in letters; but an examination of the correspondence
of writers whose letters are regarded as models
shows that most of these authors use contractions very
freely. If you will read the letters of Henry Adams,
Stevenson, Gray, Henry James, Lamb, Carroll, Walpole,
Keats, Emily Dickinson, Thackeray, Dickens, and others,
you will see that in writing to friends and members of
their families they wrote much as they would have chatted
with those to whom the letters were addressed.</p>

<p>In general, then, contractions are to be used only in
informal or friendly correspondence. In letters to strangers
and in most business correspondence they should be
avoided. Perhaps the best guide to the proper use of
contractions is to be found in the models of writers who
are famous for their personal letters.</p>

<h2>DICTATION EXERCISES</h2>

<p>The following letters contain a large number of words
which occur with relatively high frequency in correspondence,
and are quite likely to be misspelled by persons of
eighth grade education. They should be dictated in
short phrases of three to five words without repetition,
pausing after each dictated phrase for the children to
write. The rate should be such, however, that the dictation
and writing will be completed in the time designated
in the note preceding each letter. On the average this
will be about one and one-half lines per minute. A little
practice will enable the teacher to dictate at this rate
without difficulty.</p>

<p>Pupils should be able to write these letters at the
given speed without hesitation or error of spelling before
they have completed the work of this grade.</p>

    LETTER NO. 1</p>

<p>This letter should be dictated in three sections. The
first exercise extends to the end of the first paragraph,
including the heading and salutation, and should be
written in 8 minutes. The second exercise includes the
second and third paragraphs and should be written in
9 minutes. The third exercise completes the letter and
should be written in 6&ndash;&frac12; minutes.</p>

<div class="signature4"><span class="smcap">Dear Mamma,</span></div>

<p>I suppose you feel that I have been very slow about
writing, but I haven't had a minute for either letter writing
or pleasure the past few days. I took my last test
this forenoon&mdash;the terrible and much dreaded literature
examination. It lasted from ten o'clock until noon, and
though it was different from what I had expected I think I
got along all right. I probably won't get an excellent grade,
for I just had to make a guess at one answer I didn't know,
but you can't imagine how happy I am to be all through.
Tomorrow will be the last day of school and our superintendent
is going to let us celebrate with a class party.</p>

<p>Aunt Lucy wants me to stay with her another month,
but I am coming home Saturday, for I know I'll be eager
to get back to the farm just as soon as we have good
weather again. Last Sunday I accepted Edith's invitation
to spend the day with her. She lives about thirty
miles from Des Moines, and I enjoyed the drive over the
country roads. I'm sure I'll never lose my love for the farm.</p>

<p>I must tell you, too, about Edith's brother, a lieutenant,
who got his commission at the same time John did.
He is personally acquainted with John's captain and knew
several other men in that company. I was very much
interested in his account of his army experiences.</p>

<p>I appreciated the check you enclosed in your last
letter, for I needed some money for my new dress. I
never realized before this year how much it costs to clothe
a girl. I wish you were here to advise me what kind of
material to get. I miss your judgment when I try to
go shopping alone. Aunt Lucy's voile dress has given
her a great deal of service, and so I think I'll decide on
that material for my best summer dress.</p>

<p>Remember me to the boys when you write, and give my
love to Grandmother. I do hope her rheumatism is better.</p>

<p>We take this occasion to acknowledge the receipt of
your letter of the 17th inst., and sincerely appreciate the
interest which you have shown in our association. We
must find a permanent location for our Chautauqua, and
believe that we have found lots which will be satisfactory,
<a name="since" id="since"></a>especially since they are in a really pleasant locality,
convenient to the college. Since it will be necessary to
investigate this business opportunity immediately, we are
referring the matter to a committee and we feel the
analysis of the situation will be complete. The committee
to which this matter is referred will probably recommend
giving a mortgage but quite certainly will receive advice
on this point from representative citizens. The money to
carry on the investigation is in the First National Bank,
the certificate of deposit being in the hands of the treasurer
of the association.</p>

<p>If possible the members of the association would like
to issue the bulletin which contains the course by the
beginning of the season, whether the matter of permanent
grounds is thoroughly investigated, or not. Experience
has taught us, too, that the bulletins are received with
more enthusiasm at an early date.</p>

<p>The truly awful accident of last year in which two
people were killed when the tent fell will have its influence
on our present campaign for a permanent building.</p>

<p>Kindly give this matter your attention at your earliest
convenience.</p>

<div class="signature4"><span class="smcap">Dear Father,</span></div>

<p>You can see from the article which I enclose that we
did not disappoint our principal, even though it has been
impossible to practice during the past week. Under the
circumstances it doesn't seem possible that we could have
won, but maybe our success was due to having no practice
before the game. Some of the teams seemed rather
over-trained.</p>

<p>The coach changed me to right forward, although, as
you know, I usually play at guard. I suppose there was
a doubt in his mind as to whether I could guard the tall
forwards on some of the teams.</p>

<p>Our team never played together better. We didn't
have so great a variety of plays as some of the other teams,
but relied almost entirely upon our short passing game.
What I liked especially was that there wasn't a single
poor official. One of the officials was the man who spoke
last fall on our community health program.</p>

<p>I suppose the team will reach home Saturday night.
I am sure that we ought not to stay here later than Saturday
noon. The teams were entertained at the various
fraternity houses and the men have been very much
crowded to make room for us. We certainly appreciate
the good treatment we have received from these men and
from everyone.</p>

<div class="signature4">Boston, Massachusetts.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="signature4"><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Hardy</span>,</div>

<p>I am glad to make an immediate reply to your inquiry
of December 1, regarding Miss Henry's qualifications.</p>

<p>It is now eight years since Miss Henry first took a
position with us. She began as mail clerk, working up
rapidly through the ranks, until she became private secretary
to Mr. Baldwin, President of the Central Insurance
Company, in which capacity she has served for four years,
becoming an important part of the institution. We have
found her always courteous, thoroughly efficient in her
work, and absolutely reliable.</p>

<p>She is well equipped for a position on an insurance
publication because of her magazine writing, which she
has been doing in connection with a course in journalism
at the university this year. She has been most successful
in this work and hopes to find time to do more of it during
the summer term if her schedule will permit. It was only
because of her great desire to continue her education that
we were willing to accept her resignation, and we knew
that this year's work at the university would mean a
broader field for her in the future.</p>

<p>I am enclosing a record of Miss Henry's work, on the
usual form kept for each employee, showing the approximate
progress she made during her eight years with us
and her increased value to the company, and I am also
sending under separate cover Miss Henry's photograph,
as you suggested.</p>

<p>Hoping I may hear from you further if there is any
additional information you require, I am</p>

<h2>SUPPLEMENT WHICH CONTAINS CERTAIN<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;RULES AND DEFINITIONS OFTEN TAUGHT<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;AS A PART OF THE COURSE OF STUDY<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;IN SPELLING</h2>

<p>As a part of the course of study in spelling, there is <a name="is" id="is"></a>occasionally
found a provision for word study and for teaching
certain rules and definitions. The following supplement is
added as a guide in schools which make such a requirement.
Ordinarily such topics as derivation of words, root prefixes,
suffixes, homonyms, antonyms, synonyms, and hyphens are
taught, either as a part of composition or as a part of dictionary
exercises.</p>

<p>The value of teaching spelling rules is still somewhat a
matter of controversy, although the weight of experimental
evidence seems to indicate that children do not profit from a
study of the rules in spelling, as much as they profit from
the same amount of time spent in the direct study of the important
words covered by these rules. However, since some
city and state courses of study require the teaching of the
rules, it seems advisable to put the more important rules in
this supplement.</p>

<p>An effort has been made to state these rules in the simplest
manner possible, within the limits of accuracy. Great
care has been taken, also, to tabulate, for each rule, the words
frequently used in correspondence, which are exceptions.</p>

<p>The teacher should understand clearly that it is not the
intention of the authors to have these rules take the place of
the direct teaching of any word. Rather they are to be regarded
as supplementary exercises. It is doubtful whether
much attention should be given to rules before grade seven.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>DERIVATION OF WORDS</h3>

<p>Often one word is built up from several words or syllables.
The most important part of such a built-up word is called the
root, or base. This root or base had an original meaning
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
which is usually clear, especially in purely English words, as
in-side, happi-ness, etc. Many built-up or derivative words
are from other languages. A few examples may help to
illustrate:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. international&mdash;Latin inter (between) plus nation (nation)
plus al (pertaining to)&mdash;between nations, pertaining
to intercourse between nations.</p>

<p>The root is "nation."</p>

<p>2. extraordinary&mdash;Latin extra (on the outside, out of) plus
ordinarius (ordinary)&mdash;out of the ordinary, unusual.</p>

<p>The root is "ordinar."</p>

<p>3. provide&mdash;Latin pro (before) plus vid (to look or see)&mdash;to
look before or ahead, to look out for in advance.</p>

<p>The root is "vid."</p>

<p>4. convention&mdash;Latin con (together) plus ven (to come)
plus tion (act of)&mdash;act of coming together&mdash;meeting.</p>

<p>The root is "ven."</p>

<p>Many roots or bases are taken directly from the English:</p>

<p>1. out-come&mdash;act of coming out&mdash;that which comes out of
something else&mdash;result.</p>

<p>2. in-side&mdash;inner side or surface.</p>

<p>3. cheer-ful&mdash;full of cheer.</p>

<p>4. happi-ness&mdash;state of being happy.</p>
</div>

<p>In studying these words, you may have noticed that
something besides the root or base is needed to make the
meaning clear. The other two parts which help to make up
words are called prefixes and suffixes. These will be taken up
separately.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h2>PREFIXES</h2>

<p>A prefix is a word or syllable placed before another word,
and so completely joined to it that it changes the meaning of
the basic word.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Note to Teacher</span>:&mdash;Have the pupils select in the lessons
of your grade, words which have similar prefixes.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
    As you can see in the list below, the final consonant of a
prefix has often been changed to make the pronunciation easier,
but does not disappear when added to the stem. Thus, ad-cord
became ac-cord, ad-fect became af-fect, etc.</p>

<h2>SUFFIXES</h2>

<p>A suffix is a syllable or word which is added to the end of
another word to change the meaning of the basic word.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<h2>HOMONYMS</h2>

<p>A homonym is a word pronounced exactly like another,
but differing from it in meaning. A few homonyms are spelled
in the same way, as "weed," a garment, and "weed," a plant.
Only a small group of the more common type will be given here.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Note to Teacher</span>:&mdash;It has been deemed advisable to omit
giving an extensive list of homonyms here. You may refer the
pupils to the lists of homonyms which occur in the regular
spelling lessons of the first five grades. For example, the following
lists are among those which contain homonyms:&mdash;16 in
grade I; 18, 19, 20, in grade II; 12 words in 28 of grade III;
32 in grade IV; etc.</p>

<h2>SYNONYMS</h2>

<p>Synonyms are words that have almost the same meaning.
If you were to look up the simple words "cut" and "ask" you
would find the following synonyms:</p>

<p>For "cut"&mdash;carve, lance, bite, dissect, snip, saw, slice, slit,
slash, etc.</p>

<p>For "ask"&mdash;beg, crave, entreat, beseech, implore, move,
plead, solicit, etc. No two of these synonyms mean exactly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the same thing, but they express different shades of the same
meaning.</p>

<p>Practice Exercises: Find as many synonyms as you can
for the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>best<br />
decide<br />
effort<br />
deceive<br />
imagine<br />
dark<br />
time<br />
form<br />
pleasure<br />
public</p>
</div>

<p>Any lesson in the book may be used for an exercise in
discovering synonyms.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h2>ANTONYMS</h2>

<p>Words of opposite meaning are called antonyms. For
example, black&mdash;white; big&mdash;little; and open&mdash;closed, are so
named.</p>

<p>Practice Exercises: Try to think of antonyms for the
following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>cold<br />
come<br />
dull<br />
inside<br />
fat<br />
front<br />
good<br />
high<br />
in<br />
large<br />
up<br />
long<br />
new<br />
poor<br />
slow<br />
spring<br />
sweet<br />
tall<br />
wet<br />
winter</p>
</div>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h2>THE HYPHEN</h2>

<p>Authorities differ in regard to the use of the hyphen.
However, there are two rules which always hold good: (1).
The hyphen is used to separate compound adjectives; (2).
The hyphen is used to show, at the end of a line, that a word
has been divided. (Such a word must be divided between
syllables.) In other cases, when you cannot decide whether
or not to use a hyphen, consult the dictionary used in your
school. It is much less frequently used than formerly.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h2>RULES FOR SPELLING</h2>

<p><b>I. Formation of Possessives</b></p>

<p>1. The following list is made up of words in the singular
number. To form the possessive, add an apostrophe and "s."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>horse's head<br />
man's coat<br />
girl's dress<br />
boy's shoes<br />
soldier's uniform<br />
child's laugh<br />
sheep's wool<br />
sister's hat</p>
</div>

<p>2. The following list is made up of plural nouns that do
not end in "s." To form the possessive, add an apostrophe
and "s."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>children's clothes<br />
men's shirts<br />
women's praise<br />
gentlemen's plans</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
    3. The following list is made up of plural nouns ending
in "s."</p>

<p>To form the possessive, add only an apostrophe.</p>

<p><b>II. Treatment of the final consonant before a suffix</b></p>

<p>1. The following list contains words of one syllable. Notice
that each word ends in a consonant, and that in every word
there is a single short vowel preceding it. In all such words,
the final consonant is doubled before adding a suffix beginning
with a vowel.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>big&mdash;bigg (er) (est)<br />
drop&mdash;dropp(ed) (ing)<br />
stop&mdash;stopp(ed) (ing)<br />
plan&mdash;plann(ed) (ing)<br />
begin&mdash;beginn(er) (ing)</p>
</div>

<p>2. The following list contains verbs of more than one
syllable. Each verb is accented on the last syllable, and ends
in a single consonant preceded by a single short vowel. In
such verbs, the final consonant is doubled before a suffix
beginning with a vowel.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>beginn(ing)<br />
referr(ed) (ing)<br />
occurr(ed)<br />
forgott(en)<br />
remitt(ance)</p>
</div>

<p><b>III. Adding suffixes to words ending in "e"</b></p>

<p>1. A word ending in silent "e" drops the "e" before a
vowel, as:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>come&mdash;coming<br />
hope&mdash;hoping<br />
serve&mdash;serving<br />
appreciate&mdash;appreciating<br />
vote&mdash;voting</p>
</div>

<p>2. When a suffix beginning with a consonant is added to
a word ending in "e," the "e" is kept.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>announce&mdash;announce-ment<br />
hope&mdash;hope-ful<br />
late&mdash;late-ly<br />
care&mdash;care-less<br />
lone&mdash;lone-some</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
    3. "E" is retained to keep the soft sound of "c" and "g"
before "a" and "o" as in notice&mdash;notice-able, and advantage&mdash;advantage-ous.</p>

<p><b>Exceptions:</b></p>

<p>Of the words commonly used in writing letters the following
exceptions are to be made:</p>

<p>a. When a suffix beginning with a consonant is added to
a word ending in "e":</p>

<p>(1) Only three words drop "e" before adding "ment":
judgment, acknowledgment, argument.</p>

<p>(2) Only one word drops "e" before adding "ful": awful.</p>

<p>(3) Only three words drop "e" before adding "ly":</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>true&mdash;truly<br />
due&mdash;duly<br />
whole&mdash;wholly</p>
</div>

<p>b. When the last syllable of a word ends in "le," "ly"
does not make a new syllable, as: probable&mdash;-probably,
possible&mdash;possibly, simple&mdash;simply.</p>

<p>(When "ly" is added to words ending in "l," both "l's"
are retained, as: practical&mdash;practically, careful&mdash;carefully.)</p>

<p><b>IV. Treatment of the final "y"</b></p>

<p>1. To form the plural of a noun ending in "y" preceded
by a consonant, change the "y" to "i" and add "es."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>lady&mdash;ladies<br />
quantity&mdash;quantities<br />
quality&mdash;qualities</p>
</div>

<p>2. When a verb ends in "y" preceded by a consonant,
change the "y" to "i" and add "es" to form the third person
singular of the verb. To form the past tense of the verb,
change the "y" to "i" and add "ed."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>fry&mdash;fries<br />
cry&mdash;cries<br />
bury&mdash;buried<br />
carry&mdash;carried</p>
</div>

<p>3. When a word ends in "y" preceded by a vowel, form
the plural by adding "s."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>turkey&mdash;turkeys<br />
chimney&mdash;chimneys<br />
valley&mdash;valleys</p>
</div>

<p>4. When "y" is preceded by a consonant, change it to
"i" before a suffix which does not begin with "i," as in business,
readily, happiness, etc.</p>

<p>Retain "y" in such words as: hurrying, crying, flying, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
    <b>V. Treatment and use of the apostrophe</b></p>

<p>1. Put the apostrophe in the place of the absent letter or
letters: aren't, don't, didn't, can't, I'll, etc.</p>

<p>2. Possessives of personal pronouns have no apostrophe,
as: its, hers, ours, yours, etc.</p>

<p><b>VI. Irregular Plurals</b></p>

<p>Some words ending in "f" or "fe" form their plurals by
changing the "f" or "fe" to "v" and adding "es."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>half&mdash;halves<br />
knife&mdash;knives<br />
life&mdash;lives<br />
leaf&mdash;leaves<br />
calf&mdash;calves<br />
wife&mdash;wives</p>
</div>

<p><b>VII. Confusion of "ei" and "ie"</b></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Note to Teacher</span>:&mdash;Experimental evidence does not seem
to show that this rule is very effective, but if it is taught, the
following presentation is recommended.</p>
</div>

<p>Whenever "i" and "e" occur together in one syllable, and
are pronounced as "[=e]" or "[)e]," it is always "i" before "e"
except after "c" (see). When sounded like "[=a]" it is always
"e" before "i." Some have used the following jingle to help
fix the rule:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"i" before "e"<br />
Except after "c"<br />
Or when sounded like "a"<br />
As in neighbor or weigh.</p>
</div>

<p>Four of the words most commonly used in writing letters
are exceptions to these rules: neither, leisure, foreign, height.</p>
